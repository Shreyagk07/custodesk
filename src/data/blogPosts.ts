      <p>It's a scenario every manager fears: your top engineer, the one who knows the legacy codebase inside out, hands in their two weeks' notice.</p>
      
      <p>You scramble to set up handover meetings. You ask them to "write everything down." But deep down, you know it's impossible to capture five years of context in ten days.</p>
      
      <h3>The Hidden Price Tag</h3>
      <p>Most companies calculate turnover cost based on recruitment fees and onboarding time. But the real cost lies in the <strong>knowledge gap</strong>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Productivity Dip:</strong> The new hire takes 6-9 months to reach full productivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Repeated Mistakes:</strong> The team re-learns lessons that were already solved years ago.</li>
        <li><strong>Lost Relationships:</strong> Client nuances and soft knowledge vanish instantly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How AI Changes the Equation</h3>
      <p>This is where AI-driven knowledge capture comes in. Instead of relying on frantic exit interviews, modern organizations are using AI agents to continuously document processes, decisions, and context.</p>
      <p>By treating knowledge as a tangible asset that belongs to the company—not just the individual—you insulate your business from the inevitable shocks of turnover.</p>

        title: "How AI Agents are Transforming Employee Offboarding",
        excerpt: "Move from rushed Google Docs to structured, interactive knowledge bases. The future of offboarding is automated.",
        date: "Nov 28, 2025",
        author: "Mike Ross",
        category: "Technology",

      <p>The traditional offboarding process is broken. It usually involves a checklist, a generic exit interview with HR, and a request to "upload your files to the shared drive."</p>
      
      <p>The result? A digital graveyard of unorganized folders that no one ever looks at again.</p>

      <h3>Enter the AI Offboarding Agent</h3>
      <p>Imagine an AI that interviews the departing employee, but not just about why they're leaving. It asks about <em>how they did their job</em>.</p>
      
      <p>"Hey Mike, I noticed you handle the weekly reporting. Can you walk me through that process step-by-step?"</p>

      <p>The AI then:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Transcribes</strong> the conversation.</li>
        <li><strong>Extracts</strong> the key steps and login details.</li>
        <li><strong>Generates</strong> a clean, searchable how-to guide.</li>
        <li><strong>Links</strong> related documents and files automatically.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>This isn't science fiction. It's what platforms like Custodesk are doing today, turning the chaotic exit process into a structured knowledge transfer engine.</p>

        title: "Building a Culture of Knowledge Continuity",
        excerpt: "Knowledge capture shouldn't just happen at the exit interview. Learn how to build a culture where knowledge flows freely.",
        date: "Nov 15, 2025",
        author: "Jessica Pearson",
        category: "Culture",
        content: `
      <p>If you wait until someone quits to ask them what they know, you've already lost.</p>
      
      <p>Knowledge continuity isn't a project; it's a culture. It's about shifting the mindset from "my knowledge is my job security" to "sharing knowledge is my contribution."</p>

      <h3>3 Steps to Build the Culture</h3>
      <p><strong>1. Make it Easy:</strong> No one wants to write documentation. Use tools that capture knowledge from natural workflows—like recording meetings or analyzing Slack threads.</p>
      
      <p><strong>2. Reward Sharing:</strong> Celebrate the people who document their work. Make "documentation" a key metric in performance reviews.</p>
      
      <p><strong>3. Use What You Capture:</strong> Nothing kills motivation faster than a "write-only" database. Ensure that the knowledge captured is easily accessible and actually used to solve problems.</p>

        title: "5 Ways to Use Generative AI for Internal Documentation",
        excerpt: "Stop writing manuals. Start generating them. Practical tips for using LLMs to document your processes.",

      <p>Documentation is the vegetable of the corporate world. Everyone knows it's good for them, but no one wants to eat it (or write it).</p>
      
      <p>Generative AI is the seasoning that makes it palatable. Here are 5 ways to use LLMs to automate your docs:</p>

      <h3>1. Code-to-Doc</h3>
      <p>Paste a complex function into an LLM and ask it to write a README. It's surprisingly accurate and saves hours of developer time.</p>

      <h3>2. Meeting-to-SOP</h3>
      <p>Record a Loom video of a process, get the transcript, and ask AI to convert it into a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) with steps and bullets.</p>

      <h3>3. Slack-to-FAQ</h3>
      <p>Feed a support channel's history into an AI and ask it to generate a "Frequently Asked Questions" page based on real user issues.</p>

      <h3>4. Update Automation</h3>
      <p>When a process changes, tell the AI what's different and ask it to rewrite the relevant section of the documentation, keeping the tone consistent.</p>

      <h3>5. The "Explain Like I'm 5" Layer</h3>
      <p>Take technical documentation and ask AI to generate a simplified summary for non-technical stakeholders (sales, marketing, leadership).</p>
